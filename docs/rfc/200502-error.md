## Standardize error handling
I was surprised to find such rich literature on this. Important considerations
- Avoid duplication of logging, metrics and returning errors and integration with tools like
sentry, prometheus, elk ...
- Serialization across distributed systems
- Richer semantics for distributed systems like retryable error, networking err, version mismatch ...
